Lua to JavaScript Converter
This is a Lua to JavaScript converter tool that allows you to easily convert Lua code into equivalent JavaScript code. It can be used to quickly migrate Lua projects to JavaScript or to convert Lua snippets for use in JavaScript-based environments.

How to Use
Clone this repository or download the source code.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter your Lua code in the left editor panel.
Click the "Convert" button.
The converted JavaScript code will appear in the right editor panel.
Copy the converted JavaScript code and use it in your JavaScript project.
Features
Converts Lua syntax and constructs to JavaScript equivalents.
Handles basic Lua data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, tables, and functions.
Supports Lua control flow statements such as if-else, loops, and switch-case.
Handles Lua functions and anonymous functions.
Converts Lua table indexing and iteration to JavaScript object properties and array manipulation.
Translates Lua standard library functions to JavaScript equivalents where possible.
Limitations
The converter may not handle complex Lua code that heavily relies on Lua-specific features or libraries.
Some Lua language features may not have direct equivalents in JavaScript, requiring manual adaptation.
The converter focuses on converting syntax and basic constructs, but it may not guarantee fully functional code in all cases.
The generated JavaScript code may require additional modifications or adjustments to work correctly in your specific JavaScript environment.
